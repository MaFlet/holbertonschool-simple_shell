Project C: Building our own simple shell

Name:
. Simple Shell (C Shell), - Operating command system,
UNIX command line interpreter.

Description:
. A Shell - acts like a commmand interpreter. The user inputs a
command after a prompt with a symbol like "$" that executes commands
to view set of files and directory within the operating system. It
is an interface of the operating system where control process when
created and searching different files and directories.

Synopsis:

. Interactive shell and Non-Interactive mode (Initial process to set
your own simple)

In the main.c file:

int main(void)
{

	signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);

	if (isatty(STDIN_FILENO))
	{
		interactive_mode();
	}
	else
	{
		noninteractive_mode();
	}
	clean_up();

	return (0);
}
. SIGNIT is generated by CTRL + C (from keyboard) by the user to signal
termination of the program.

. isatty() function determine if the fd (file descriptor) is an open file
which is the terminal. It returns to 1 if the fd is process or referring to
a terminal 0 if otherwise, which in this case an interactive mode shell. A
fd is a unique process identification integer that handles an open file within
the operating shell system.

. isatty(STDIN_FILENO) including the isatty() function will check and test
whether there is an open file in the terminal and whether it is belonging to
the terminal.

. Interactive vs non-interactive why both?

. From its name itself, "interactive" is where the user inputs commands where
shell can execute whatever the user wants to see. 

. Example:

root@6c487c8d534f43c1af356748b4825b6b-2377118072:/holbertonschool-simple_shell# ./hsh
cisfun$ /bin/ls

. After displying the prompt (cisfun$), the user prompted a commmand that allows to
list all files and directories in the current directory. When user type and  prompted
with 'exit' it will terminate the program.

. Now what is a "Non-interactive" shell, it is still a processing shell but assuming
it does not interact with the user. However, it is CRITICAL to include the
non-interactive function for your simple shell. It also  handles the PATH environmental
variable (refer PATH variable on how to set and handle section), where its continually
look for executable commands in the background. It make sure to find the right commands
to excute without the user's interuption.
